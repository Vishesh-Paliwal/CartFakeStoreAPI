To Set up (Use any IDE [Preffered : Intelli J ]);
clone my repo;
add required dependencies like Lombok,etc.
Either generate hhtp request in Intelli J itself , or use PostMan dektop version to generate request at localhost
I have added Images in Images Folder on how to make request , and the output is clearly visible there as well
